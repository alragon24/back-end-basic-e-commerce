# back-end-basic-e-commerce
The goal of this project was to create a basic E-Commerce Backend that allowed basic POST, GET, DEL, and PUT requests with a connected Database, hosted via ExpressJS!
This program soley relies on MySQL again, instead, is working with different skills to control and distribute data better to user/program.
